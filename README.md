# Node-Server-with-Mobile-Phones

This is a fork of [jameswburke/Node-Server-with-Mobile-Phones].

A Node.js server that creates a desktop client which connects to multiple mobile phones to utilize tilt data as player controls.

I've updated the original example to include various javascript device API's and respective socket events.

### Usage

Navigate to http://198.61.194.180:8080 on the screen you would like to connect to. Then, on your mobile device, connect to http://198.61.194.180:8080/mobile.html.

Tip:
 - To move around, tilt your mobile device.
 - To change your color, tap/swipe on the gray area on your mobile device.
 - To make your mobile device vibrate, hold down on the gray area on your mobile device.

### Device APIs

Device API's include:
  - Geolocation
  - Orientation
  - Battery
  - Device Light
  - Ambient Light
  - Device Proximity
  - User Proximity
  - Vibration
